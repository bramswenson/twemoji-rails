# twemoji-rails

twemoji! For Rails! So great.

This gem provides:

  * twemoji.js

## Installation

The twemoji file will be added to the asset pipeline and available for you to use. If they're not already in `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` by default, add these lines:

```js
//= require twemoji
```

## Contributing

Feel free to open an issue ticket if you find something that could be improved. A couple notes:

* If it's an issue pertaining to the twemoji javascript, please report it to the [twemoji project](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji).

* If the twemoji scripts are outdated (i.e. maybe a new version of twemoji was released yesterday), feel free to open an issue and prod us to get that thing updated. However, for security reasons, we won't be accepting pull requests with updated twemoji scripts.
